		<h1>5-1</h1>
		<h3>5. Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors, PG)</h3>
		<p>Steph Curry is one of the best three-point sharpshooters ever. He revolutionized the modern day NBA and transformed it into a three point shooting league. The back to back MVP averaged 27, 5, and 5 last season on near 50, 40, 90 club shooting. Curry suffered from a few injuries during the season, but managed to stay relatively healthy in the playoffs to help the Warriors make the finals yet again. The one thing Curry lacks, that isn’t already at an elite level for a guard, is his defense, which is about average, but when you can shoot the ball like Curry does, it won’t concern you that much.</p>

		<h3>4. Kevin Durant (Brooklyn Nets, SF/PF)</h3>
		<p>KD is one of the NBA's most lethal scorers currently and even all time. His elite shooting ability that is better than most guards mixed with his size and frame, making him as tall as a center, is what makes him one of the deadliest scorers ever. If you guard Durant too far, he can just shoot over you and if you guard him too tight, he can drive in for a layup or dunk. This season Durant will be sitting out due to an Achilles injury he suffered in the NBA finals, when he comes back, if he has the same production as before the injury, the Nets will be an instant title contender.</p>

		<h3>3. Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks, PF/SF)</h3>
		<p>The 2019 regular season MVP comes in at number 3.  In his MVP season, Giannis averaged 27.7 PPG, 12.5 RPG, and 5.9 APG on pretty good field goal percentage. The Greek Freak is an extremely versatile power forward due to his size and length. His offensive game is nearly unstoppable and his defense is also elite. Last season, Giannis led the Bucks to the first seed in the eastern conference and eventually lost to Toronto in the conference finals. One thing Giannis has to improve is his shooting, but he still has lots of time to improve as he is only 24 years old.</p>

		<h3>2. LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers, SF/PF)</h3>
		<p>King James is widely regarded as one of the greatest to ever do it because of his huge list of awards and records, and also his electrifying play style that is so fun to watch. Even at 34 years of age, LeBron is still one of the best players in the NBA. Last season LeBron averaged 27, 8, and 8, but on a disappointing Lakers team due to injuries. This offseason the Lakers acquired superstar Anthony Davis to play alongside James. This Lakers team has high expectations to win a championship and that will require LeBron to step up even more than he already has.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>1. Kawhi Leonard (Los Angeles Clippers, SF)</h3>
		<p>The 2019 finals MVP is ranked as the best player in the NBA for this upcoming season. Kawhi managed to average 26.6 PTS, 7.3 REB, and 3.3 AST, last season while load managing too. Leonard carried the Raptors to their first ever title, while having one of the best individual playoff runs ever. Kawhi is an amazing scorer, as he is able to shoot the ball efficiently and also drive to the hoop. Kawhi is also one of the best defenders in the league, as he has won two DPOY awards. This season we will see if Kawhi can lead the Clippers to a championship and win back to back rings on separate teams.</p>
