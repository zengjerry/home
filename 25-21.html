		<h1>25-21</h1>
		<h3>25. Donovan Mitchell (Utah Jazz, SG)</h3>
		<p>The 23 year old shooting guard for the Utah Jazz is coming in at number 25 on this list. Last season Mitchell averaged 23.8 PPG, 4.1 RPG, and 4.2 APG on 43.2, 36.2, and 80.6% splits. This upcoming season will be his 3rd season in the league. In the offseason, Utah traded for Mike Conely, creating a big 3 of Gobert, Mitchell, and Conely that should make the playoffs, despite a loaded west. I expect Mitchell to take the next jump and become an All-Star this upcoming season.</p>

		<h3>24. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors, PF)</h3>
		<p>Coming off a championship run and a most improved player award, Pascal Siakam is a borderline All-Star, averaging 17, 7, and 3 on 55% FG. The 6’9” power forward blossomed into a star last season, playing alongside Kawhi Leonard and helping him bring Toronto it’s first championship title. Now that Kawhi is gone from Toronto, the team is now his. If the Raptors want to remain as a top team in the east, Siakam will have to take the next step up and hopefully become an All-Star and an All-NBA Team candidate.</p>

		<h3>23. D'Angelo Russell (Golden State Warriors, PG)</h3>
		<p>D’Lo is ranked at 23 on this list for his outstanding offensive game and carrying the Nets last season to the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference. Last season Russell averaged 21, 4, and 7, but on 43.4 FG% which is slightly below the league average of 46%. D’Angelo will be playing for the Golden State Warriors this year alongside All-Star guards Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson (currently injured), and also former All-Star and DPOY, Draymond Green. In my opinion, this Warriors team is still a championship contender, despite the loss of Kevin Durant. The next step Russell has to take, is to improve defensively, which he can learn from Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, two of the league’s elite defenders.</p>

		<h3>22. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers, PG/PF)</h3>
		<p>The 6’10” point guard is heading into his third year, after making his first All-Star appearance, and the year before that, achieving the rookie of the year award. Simmons averaged about 17, 9, and 8 last year on pretty good field goal percentage (56.3%), but he also had poor free throw efficiency and don’t even get me started on his three point percentage. Ben Simmons is an extremely versatile point guard because of his size and frame, but to take his game to the next level he is going to have to develop a jump shot.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>21. Blake Griffin (Detroit Pistons, PF)</h3>
		<p>Standing at 6’10”, 250lb, Blake Griffin is the All-Star power forward for the Detroit Pistons. Last season Blake averaged 24.5 PTS, 7.5 REB, and 5.4 AST on 46.2 FG%, 36.2 3PT%, and 75.3 FT%. He's currently coming off a third team All-NBA selection and an All-Star selection. Over the years, Blake has really improved his jump shot, last season he made more pull-up threes on a better percentage than Kyrie Irving, CJ McCollum, and Devin Booker. If Griffin can stay healthy throughout the season, him and the pistons should have no problem making the playoffs as a 6 or 7 seed.</p>
